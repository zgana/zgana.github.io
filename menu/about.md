I am a data scientist fresh out of academia after many years in physics.  I
spent the 2010's searching for astrophysical sources of neutrinos: tiny
elusive particles that, amazingly, are so far most conveniently observed using
a detector [at the South Pole](https://icecube.wisc.edu/).

As we enter the 2020's, I'm transitioning into data science.  On this page I
plan to share thoughts on that transition, on interesting datasets and methods,
and related topics.


## lo selzga?

When I signed up for GitHub, I was very interested in a [constructed
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) called
[lojban](http://www.lojban.org/).  *lojban* [there's no capitalization in this
language] means *logical language* in lojban.

In lojbanic "culture", to the extent it exists, it is common for people to
choose a lojbanic name for themselves.  I chose *la zgana*, which translates
approximately into *a/the observer*.  Thus, I chose the GitHub handle
[@zgana](https://github.com/zgana).

*lo selzga* (or, *lo se zgana*) is approximately *that which is observed*,
which seemed like a fitting title for my first serious blogging attempt through
GitHub Pages.
